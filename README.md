# MaxSubarray
This is Assignment 1 for Algorithms &amp; Computing Theory course. The purpose of the project is to implement three algorithms for Max Subarray problem, as well as measure the performance and analyse time complexity.

# Algorithsms:
1. Brute Force
2. Divide and Conquer
3. Kadane Algorithm

Brute Force and Divide and Conquer algorithms follow pseudocode provided by the Professor.
